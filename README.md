# Shopping_trends

## Project Overview
This data analysis project aims at providing insights for the shopping trend in an e-commerce company based in the US. By analyzing various aspects of the shopping data we seek to identify trends, make deeper understanding of the business performance and then make data driven recommendations for increasing performance in the upcoming years.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is the shopping_trends.csv file downloaded from Kaggle, consisting of 3900 rows and 19 columns originally.

## Tools Used
- MS Excel (Data Cleaning)
- VS Code  (Data Exploration/ EDA)
- Power BI (Data Visualization)
- Power Point (Reporting & summary)

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I did below:
1. Data loading & inspection.
2. Handling Missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In EDA, I performed below steps:
1. Customer segmentation by frequency of purchase.
2. Top selling categories & products.

## Data Analysis
1. Revenue Insights
2. Purchase Behavior

## Summary & Findings
The analysis results are summarized as below:
1. Most revenue comes from Frequent & Regular buyers.
2. Certain products like Blouse, jewelry, pants, shirts drive the most sales.
3. Some states/cities like Montana, Illinois & California contribute the most revenue.
4. Some locations like Kansas, Hawaii & Florida  have low sales.
5. Current average purchase per customer is $60.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommmend the following actions:
1. Implement loyalty programs or personalized discounts for Occasional & Rare buyers to increase retention.
2. Invest in higher stock levels & better promotions for these high demand items to maximize revenue.
3. Increase marketing efforts & store presence in high-revenue areas.
4. Conduct market research to identify reasons (low demand, pricing issues, etc.) & adjust strategies accordingly.
5. Encourage bundled offers or discounts for bulk purchases to increase order value.
